# FilES

Ransomware attacks are increasing daily with most attackers
holding data ransom by encrypting it and threatening to sell/publish it.
Data can easily be stolen - why not encrypt it so that any stolen data is
useless for attackers?

## Goal

Provide a GUI tool to encrypt files with AES-256 - 
the NIST and NSA-certified
algorithm sufficient to keep State-Secrets classified.

## Progress

AES encryption and Key/IV saving has been completed, actual File
Interface and GUI still in progress
